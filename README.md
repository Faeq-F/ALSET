Track following robot using the EV3 kit, LeJOS (Java for Lego Mindstorms) and an Android phone
<br>
<br>
This repository consists of two projects:
 - Android Phone App
 - EV3 program

The Android phone app is is needed to work with the EV3 program; they connect via bluetooth and exchange navigation messages over the link.
<br>
The Android phone app is like the robots 'eyes' and 'brains' while the EV3 is the body, listening to the messages it recieves and tries its best to follow them.
